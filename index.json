For instance, they are used to summarize genetic aberrations—copy number alterations or mutations—observed in cancer patient cohorts, effectively highlighting combinatorial relations among them. One of these is the tendency for two or more genes not to be co-mutated in the same sample or patient, i.e. a mutual-exclusivity trend. Exploiting this principle has allowed identifying new cancer driver protein-interaction networks and has been proposed to design effective combinatorial anti-cancer therapies rationally. Several tools exist to identify and statistically assess mutualexclusive cancer-driver genomic events. However, these tools need to be equipped with robust/efﬁcient methods to sort rows and columns of a binary matrix to visually highlight possible mutual-exclusivity trends.","tags":[],"title":"A heuristic algorithm solving the mutual-exclusivity-sorting problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Vinceti","Riccardo Roberto De Lucia","Paolo Cremaschi","Umberto Perron","Emre Karakoc","Luca Mauri","Carlos Fernandez","Krzysztof Henryk Kluczynski","Daniel Stephen Anderson","Francesco Iorio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680971409,"objectID":"601b4cb8787b239e272ae28a4d8dd40d","permalink":"https://UmbertoPerron.github.io/publication/vinceti-interactive-2023/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T16:30:09.123412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vinceti-interactive-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An interactive web application for processing, correcting, and visualizing genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Umberto Perron","Elena Grassi","Aikaterini Chatzipli","Marco Viviani","Emre Karakoc","Lucia Trastulla","Claudio Isella","Eugenia R Zanella","Hagen Klett","Ivan Molineris","Julia Schueler","Manel Esteller","Enzo Medico","Nathalie Conte","Ultan McDermott","Livio Trusolino","Andrea Bertotti","Francesco Iorio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680971409,"objectID":"ca41d1ee2588560397c77b14493b8105","permalink":"https://UmbertoPerron.github.io/publication/perron-integrative-2023/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T16:30:09.055901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/perron-integrative-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are tumour fragments engrafted into mice for preclinical studies.

Our study shows that large PDX collections can be used to train accurate, interpretable models of drug sensitivity, which 1) better recapitulate patient-derived therapeutic biomarkers than other models trained on CCL data, 2) can be robustly validated across independent PDX cohorts, and 3) can be used for the development of novel therapeutic biomarkers.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative ensemble modelling of cetuximab sensitivity in colorectal cancer PDXs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Vinceti","Umberto Perron","Lucia Trastulla","Francesco Iorio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680971408,"objectID":"0a88a5db3305578b3e8a98f963546196","permalink":"https://UmbertoPerron.github.io/publication/vinceti-reduced-2022/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T16:30:08.92279Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vinceti-reduced-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens are furthering our mechanistic understanding of human biology and have allowed us to identify new oncology therapeutic targets.

A popular model in continuous phylogeography — with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates — describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.","tags":[],"title":"Sampling bias and model choice in continuous phylogeography: getting lost on a random walk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanna Najgebauer","Umberto Perron","Francesco Iorio"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680971408,"objectID":"27d98a2ab59c6cea260b8c2105776339","permalink":"https://UmbertoPerron.github.io/publication/najgebauer-redefining-2021/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T16:30:08.385697Z","relpermalink":"/publication/najgebauer-redefining-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Redefining false discoveries in cancer data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudia C.

Ideally, a model of sequence evolution should capture both the process that generates genetic variation and the functional constraints determining which changes are fixed. However, in practical terms the most suitable approach may simply be the one that combines the convenience of easily available input data with the ability to return useful parameter estimates. For example, we might be interested in a measure of the strength of selection (typically obtained using a codon model) or an ancestral structure (obtained using structural modelling based on inferred amino acid sequence and side chain configuration). But what if data in the relevant state-space are not readily available? We show that it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of the outputs of interest using an established method for handling missing data. Encoding observed characters in an alignment as ambiguous representations of characters in a larger state-space allows the application of models with the desired features to data that lack the resolution that is normally required. This strategy is viable because the evolutionary path taken through the observed space contains information about states that were likely visited in the “unseen” state-space. To illustrate this, we consider two examples with amino acid sequences as input.  We show that ω , a parameter describing the relative strength of selection on non-synonymous and synonymous changes, can be estimated in an unbiased manner using an adapted version of a standard 61-state codon model. Using simulated and empirical data, we find that ancestral amino acid side chain configuration can be inferred by applying a 55-state empirical model to 20-state amino acid data. Where feasible, combining inputs from both ambiguity-coded and fully resolved data improves accuracy. Adding structural information to as few as 12.5% of the sequences in an amino acid alignment results in remarkable ancestral reconstruction performance compared to a benchmark that considers the full rotamer state information. These examples show that our methods permit the recovery of evolutionary information from sequences where it has previously been inaccessible.","tags":[],"title":"Ambiguity coding allows accurate inference of evolutionary parameters from alignments in an aggregated state-space","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We present a structurally-aware empirical substitution model for amino acid sequence evolution in which proteins are expressed using an expanded alphabet that relays both amino acid identity and structural information. Each character specifies an amino acid as well a rotamer state: the discrete geometric pattern of permitted side-chain atomic positions. By assigning rotamer states in 251,194 protein structures and identifying 4,508,390 substitutions between closely related sequences, we generate a 55-state model that shows that the evolutionary properties of amino acids depend strongly upon side-chain geometry. The model performs as well as or better than traditional 20-state models for divergence time estimation, tree inference and ancestral state reconstruction. We conclude that the concomitant evolution of sequence and structure is a valuable source of phylogenetic information.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling structural constraints on protein evolution via side-chain conformational states","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Umberto Perron","Paolo Provero","Ivan Molineris"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680971408,"objectID":"d5990e7ec0b3c94b055bafa91e830866","permalink":"https://UmbertoPerron.github.io/publication/perron-2017/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T16:30:08.589293Z","relpermalink":"/publication/perron-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND In recent years long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been the subject of increasing interest. Thanks to many recent functional studies, the existence of a large class of lncRNAs with potential regulatory functions is now widely accepted. Although an increasing number of lncRNAs is being characterized and shown to be involved in many biological processes, the functions of the vast majority lncRNA genes is still unknown. Therefore computational methods able to take advantage of the increasing amount of publicly available data to predict lncRNA functions could be very useful. RESULTS Since coding genes are much better annotated than lncRNAs, we attempted to project known functional information regarding proteins onto non coding genes using the guilt by association principle: if a gene shows an expression profile that correlates with those of a set of coding genes involved in a given function, that gene is probably involved in the same function. We computed gene coexpression for 30 human tissues and 9 vertebrates and mined the resulting networks with a methodology inspired by the rank product algorithm used to identify differentially expressed genes. Using different types of reference data we can predict putative new annotations for thousands of lncRNAs and proteins, ranging from cellular localization to relevance for disease and cancer. CONCLUSIONS New function of coding genes and lncRNA can be profitably predicted using tissue specific coexpression, as well as expression of orthologous genes in different species.
